# 🎓 EDA on Student Performance Data

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset related to student academic performance.  
The goal is to identify patterns and relationships between **demographic factors**, **parental education**, **study habits**, and **exam results**, providing insights that can help improve educational outcomes.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python (3.x)**  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – For interactive exploration

## 📊 Key Insights

1. **Gender Differences:** Female students tend to score slightly higher in reading and writing, while male students perform better in math.  
2. **Parental Education Impact:** Higher parental education levels correlate with better student performance.  
3. **Test Preparation:** Students who completed test preparation courses scored significantly higher in all subjects.  
4. **Lunch Type Influence:** Standard lunch students performed better compared to those on free/reduced lunch programs.  
5. **Score Correlations:** Math, reading, and writing scores show strong positive correlations.
